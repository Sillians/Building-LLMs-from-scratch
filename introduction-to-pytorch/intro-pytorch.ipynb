    "recognizing patterns, and making decisions. (Despite significant progress, AI is still far from\n",
    "achieving this level of general intelligence.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning represents a subfield of AI that focuses on developing and improving learning algorithms. The key idea behind machine learning is to enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. This involves developing algorithms that can identify patterns and learn from historical data and improve their performance over time with more data and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is also behind technologies like recommendation systems used by online retailers and streaming services, email spam filtering, voice recognition in virtual assistants, and even self-driving cars. The introduction and advancement of machine learning have significantly enhanced AI's capabilities, enabling it to move beyond strict rule-based systems and adapt to new inputs or changing environments.\n",

    "\"deep\" in deep learning refers to the multiple hidden layers of artificial neurons or nodes\n",
    "that allow them to model complex, nonlinear relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional machine learning techniques that excel at simple pattern recognition,\n",

    "Using a learning algorithm, a model is trained on a training dataset consisting of examples\n",

    "`Figure A.8` shows partial derivatives, which measure the rate at which a function changes with respect to one of its variables. A gradient is a vector containing all of the partial derivatives of a multivariate function, a function with more than one variable as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar or don't remember the `partial derivatives`, `gradients`, or the `chain rule` from calculus, don't worry. On a high level, all you need to know for this book is that the chain rule is a way to compute gradients of a loss function with respect to the model's parameters in a computation graph. This provides the information needed to update each parameter in a way that minimizes the loss function, which serves as a proxy for measuring the model's performance, using a method such as gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "the automatic differentiation `(autograd)` engine? By tracking every operation performed on tensors, PyTorch's `autograd` engine constructs a computational graph in the background. Then, calling the `grad` function, we can compute the gradient of the loss with respect to model parameter `w1` as follows:"
