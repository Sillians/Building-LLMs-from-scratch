    "backpropagation and model optimization.\n",

    "Finally, PyTorch is a deep learning library, meaning that it offers modular, flexible, and\n",

    "usually require human intelligence. These tasks include understanding natural language,\n",
    "recognizing patterns, and making decisions. (Despite significant progress, AI is still far from\n",
    "achieving this level of general intelligence.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning represents a subfield of AI that focuses on developing and improving learning algorithms. The key idea behind machine learning is to enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. This involves developing algorithms that can identify patterns and learn from historical data and improve their performance over time with more data and feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is also behind technologies like recommendation systems used by online retailers and streaming services, email spam filtering, voice recognition in virtual assistants, and even self-driving cars. The introduction and advancement of machine learning have significantly enhanced AI's capabilities, enabling it to move beyond strict rule-based systems and adapt to new inputs or changing environments.\n",

    "\"deep\" in deep learning refers to the multiple hidden layers of artificial neurons or nodes\n",
    "that allow them to model complex, nonlinear relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional machine learning techniques that excel at simple pattern recognition,\n",
    "deep learning is particularly good at handling unstructured data like images, audio, or text,\n",
    "so deep learning is particularly well suited for LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a learning algorithm, a model is trained on a training dataset consisting of examples\n",
    "and corresponding labels. In the case of an email spam classifier, for example, the training\n",
    "dataset consists of emails and their spam and not-spam labels that a human identified.\n",

    "`Figure A.8` shows partial derivatives, which measure the rate at which a function changes with respect to one of its variables. A gradient is a vector containing all of the partial derivatives of a multivariate function, a function with more than one variable as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar or don't remember the `partial derivatives`, `gradients`, or the `chain rule` from calculus, don't worry. On a high level, all you need to know for this book is that the chain rule is a way to compute gradients of a loss function with respect to the model's parameters in a computation graph. This provides the information needed to update each parameter in a way that minimizes the loss function, which serves as a proxy for measuring the model's performance, using a method such as gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "the automatic differentiation `(autograd)` engine? By tracking every operation performed on tensors, PyTorch's `autograd` engine constructs a computational graph in the background. Then, calling the `grad` function, we can compute the gradient of the loss with respect to model parameter `w1` as follows:"

    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, a `DataLoader` is a `utility class` within the `torch.utils.data` module that facilitates efficient data loading for training and evaluating machine learning models. It acts as an interface between your dataset and the model, abstracting away complexities like batching, shuffling, and parallel data loading.\n",

    "\n",

This is crucial for efficient training, especially with large datasets, as it allows for `parallel processing` and better utilization of hardware resources.\n",

    "Lastly, let's discuss the setting `num_workers=0` in the `DataLoader`. This parameter in PyTorch's `DataLoader` function is crucial for `parallelizing` data loading and preprocessing. When `num_workers` is set to `0`, the data loading will be done in the main process and not in separate worker processes. This might seem unproblematic, but it can lead to significant slowdowns during model training when we train larger networks on a GPU. This is because instead of focusing solely on the processing of the deep learning model, the CPU must also take time to load and preprocess the data. As a result, the GPU can sit idle while waiting for the CPU to finish these tasks. In contrast, when `num_workers` is set to a number greater than zero, multiple worker processes are launched to load data in parallel, freeing the main process to focus on training your model and better utilizing your system's resources, which is illustrated in figure below:"

On the contrary, if you are working with tiny datasets or interactive environments such as Jupyter notebooks, increasing `num_workers` may not provide any noticeable speedup. They might, in fact, lead to some issues. One potential issue is the overhead of spinning up multiple worker processes, which could take longer than the actual data loading when your dataset is small.\n",

Since we don't have `dropout` or other components in our `NeuralNetwork` class that are affected by these settings, using `model.train()` and `model.eval()` is redundant in our code above.
