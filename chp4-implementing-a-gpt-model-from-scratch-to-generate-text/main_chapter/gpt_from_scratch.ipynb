    "- Training deep neural networks with many layers can sometimes prove challenging due to issues like `vanishing` or `exploding` gradients. These issues lead to unstable training dynamics and make it difficult for the network to effectively adjust its weights, which means the learning process struggles to find a set of parameters (weights) for the neural network that minimizes the `loss function`. In other words, the network has difficulty learning the underlying patterns in the data to a degree that would allow it to make accurate predictions or decisions. \n",
