    "## Normalizing activations with layer normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training deep neural networks with many layers can sometimes prove challenging due to issues like `vanishing` or `exploding` gradients. These issues lead to unstable training dynamics and make it difficult for the network to effectively adjust its weights, which means the learning process struggles to find a set of parameters (weights) for the neural network that minimizes the `loss function`. In other words, the network has difficulty learning the underlying patterns in the data to a degree that would allow it to make accurate predictions or decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will implement a  `layer normalization` to improve the stability and efficiency of neural network training.\n",
    "- The main idea behind `layer normalization` is to adjust the activations (outputs) of a neural network layer to have a mean of `0` and a variance of `1`, also know as `unit variance`.\n",
    "- This adjustment speeds up the convergence to effective weights and ensures consistent, reliable training. \n",
    "- Layer normalization is applied both before and after the multi-head attention module within the transformer block, which we will implement later.\n",
    "- It's also applied before the final output layer.\n",
