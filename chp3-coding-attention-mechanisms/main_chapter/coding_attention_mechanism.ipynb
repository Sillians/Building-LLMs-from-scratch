For instance, when scaling up the embedding dimension, which is typically greater than thousand for GPT-like LLMs, large dot products can result in very small gradients during backpropagation due to the softmax function applied to them. As dot products increase, the softmax function behaves more like a step function, resulting in gradients nearing zero. These small gradients can drastically slow down learning or cause training to stagnate. The scaling by the square root of the embedding dimension is the reason why this self-attention mechanism is also called scaled-dot product attention.`"

    "\n",
    "Multi-Head Attention is an **extension of the attention mechanism** where instead of performing a single attention function, the model applies attention multiple times in parallel (with different learned projections of queries, keys, and values).\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs of these attention “heads” are then concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables the model to capture **different types of relationships and patterns** in the data simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Mathematical Formulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Input query $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{model}}$\n",
    "* Keys $K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{model}}$\n",

    "  * One head may focus on **local context**.\n",
    "  * Another may capture **long-range dependencies**.\n",
