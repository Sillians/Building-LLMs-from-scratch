For instance, when scaling up the embedding dimension, which is typically greater than thousand for GPT-like LLMs, large dot products can result in very small gradients during backpropagation due to the softmax function applied to them. As dot products increase, the softmax function behaves more like a step function, resulting in gradients nearing zero. These small gradients can drastically slow down learning or cause training to stagnate. The scaling by the square root of the embedding dimension is the reason why this self-attention mechanism is also called scaled-dot product attention.`"

    "\n",
    "A `\"query\"` is analogous to a search query in a database. It represents the current item (e.g., a word or token in a sentence) the model focuses on or tries to understand. The query is used to probe the other parts of the input sequence to determine how much attention to pay to them.\n",

    "Casual attention, also known as `masked attention`, is a specialized form of self-attention. It restricts a model to only consider previous and current inputs in a sequence when processing any given token. This is in contrast to the standard self-attention mechanism, which allows access to the entire input sequence at once.\n",
